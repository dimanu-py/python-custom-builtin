## Introduction

In Python, we can use different types of collections to store data. The most common ones are lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

All these built-in collections implement the `Collection` protocol, which acts as an abstraction for the different types of collections.

The `Collection` at the same time depends on the `Container`, `Iterable`, and `Sized` protocols.

<details><summary>Container</summary>

- It defines the `__contains__` method, which is used to check if a collection contains a specific element.
- By implementing the `__contains__` method, a collection can be used in the `in`  and `not` operators.

</details>

<details><summary>Iterable</summary>

- It defines the `__iter__` method, which is used to iterate over the elements of a collection.
- By implementing the `__iter__` method, a collection can be used in a `for` loop.

</details>

<details><summary>Sized</summary>

- It defines the `__len__` method, which is used to get the number of elements in a collection.
- By implementing the `__len__` method, a collection can be used in the `len` function.

## Built-in dictionary

The class diagram of the built-in dictionary is shown below.

In Python, we can create a dictionary in two ways using the [overload decorator](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/overload-functions-in-python-d045375cff04):

1. Passing a sequence of key-value pairs to the `dict` constructor.
    
    ```python
    my_dict = dict({"a": 42, "b": 43, "c": 44})
    ```
2. Passing a list of tuples with key-value pairs to the `dict` constructor.

    ```python
    my_dict = dict([("a", 42), ("b", 43), ("c", 44)])
    ```

## Custom dictionary

We want to create a custom immutable dictionary. The goal is to be able to load our dictionary-like mapping once with
its keys and values, and then use it to map the keys to their values.

We want to end up with a type hint like this:

```python
BaseMapping = Mapping[Comparable, Any]
```

We are going to create a dictionary-like mapping from some key to an object of any type.

We've defined the key as `Comparable` because we want to be able to compare the keys and sort them in order.
